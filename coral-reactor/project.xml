  <description>
    Coral is as an object oriented database. It manages structured resources, that 
    can be mapped to Java objects in a JDBC relational database. 
    
    Besides simple object persistency mechanism Coral provides an expressive 
    security system, many kinds of resources relations (intrinsic tree organization 
    or resources, reference attributes, set theory relations) and a powerful query 
    facility that can use attribute values and resource relations to select objects 
    from the store.
