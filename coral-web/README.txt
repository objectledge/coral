Welcome to Coral!

Coral is as an object oriented database. It manages structured resources, that 
can be mapped to Java objects in a JDBC relational database. Besides simple
object persistency mechanism Coral provides an expressive security system, 
many kinds of resources relations (intrinsic tree organization or resources, 
reference attributes, set theory relations) and a powerful query facility that 
can use attribute values and resource relations to select objects from the 
store. The resources can be manipulated through Java API, or interactively using
RML script language. Resource types can be created and modified at runtime 
(existing resource instances are aproprietly adjusted). Java wrapper sources for
the resources can be genereated using a Maven plugin from RML scripts, or a live
database instance. Datatype schemata and security information can be exported
to RML scripts, and resources can be imported/exported using XML.
